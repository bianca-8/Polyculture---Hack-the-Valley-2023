<p>Our project, Polyculture, is a scroller game that combines the Ontario indigenous culture curriculum with a fun, interactive game that makes the learning experience more engaging for students.</p>
<p>Competed against 330 Participants</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
In the 94 Calls to Action, many calls highlight the development of education for reconciliation curriculum. We identified two issues regarding this topic:

Lack of awareness and appreciation of the Indigenous culture
Not a lot of interactive and fun platforms to educate students on the indigenous culture
To target these two issues, we were inspired to create a program that helps with language/culture learning.

<h2>What it does</h2>
Scroller game where the player controls a fox to collect items that impact Indigenous life. The player must then answer a true/false question about indigenous life correctly within a set time limit when they hit an item to gain the most amount of points.
